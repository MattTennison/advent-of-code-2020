# Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

This repository is a collection of my attempts at Advent of Code 2020 in Ruby. I hadn't done much Ruby before this, so it's been a learning curve but overall I've enjoyed it.

Each day is in a seperate file under /lib, and I've been running them via `irb`. I took a TDD approach to development (partially to save me manually re-running a hundred times!), with RSpec tests based on the examples given. These can be found under /spec, again, one per day. I've tried to write detailed commits when I ran into thorny edge cases or performance gotchas, or just to document my learnings.

If you've got any feedback, particuarly around recommendations on how to improve my Ruby, I'd love to hear it.
